## Product Instructions
### Blender 3D Modeling

Full access to Blender, the industry-standard 3D creation suite, running headless in the cloud. Render images and videos from 3D models, convert between file formats, and run custom Blender Python scripts.

#### How It Works

Render actions (`render_turntable`, `render_views`, `render_custom`, `run_script`, `check_printability`, `fix_printability`, `voxel_remesh`, `slice_for_printing`) run **asynchronously**. They return immediately with a `task_id` and `status: "processing"`. The render runs in the background. Use `get_task` to check progress and retrieve download links when complete.

`convert_format` runs **synchronously** and returns the converted file immediately (typically under 5 seconds).

The GPU runs one render at a time. When you submit while another job is in flight, your request joins a strict-FIFO queue and `get_task` returns three additional fields so you can plan around the wait:

- `queue_position` — `0` while running, otherwise the 1-based slot in line.
- `queue_eta_seconds` — best-guess seconds until the job is dequeued.
- `queue_stats` — `{queue_total_running, queue_total_queued, queue_total_capacity}`.

A submitted task that you no longer need can be cancelled with `cancel_task`. Cancellation works whether the task is still queued or actively rendering — see the action's docs for the contract.

#### Quick Start For Agents

Use this decision flow when choosing an action:

1. Need a spinning preview video of an existing model: call `render_turntable`.
2. Need front/top/side/3quarter still images of an existing model: call `render_views`.
3. Need one specific camera angle: call `render_custom`.
4. Need to change model file format, including exporting a native `.blend` file: call `convert_format`.
5. Need to know if a model is 3D-printable: call `check_printability`.
6. Need a light-touch cleaned export of a *mostly-clean* model (CAD output, hand-modeled mesh with a few stray non-manifolds): call `fix_printability`.
7. Need to repair a *structurally-broken* organic model (3D-modeled / sculpted shapes with overlapping geometry, photogrammetry exports, self-intersecting Boolean unions, inverted-normal regions, dense multi-shell tessellation): call `voxel_remesh`.
8. Need to slice a model and get print time / filament estimates: call `slice_for_printing`.
9. Need to create or modify geometry/materials/lighting with Blender Python, render custom media, or save several files: call `run_script`.
10. Need the result from an async action: call `get_task` with the returned `task_id`.
11. Need recent work history: call `list_tasks`.
12. Need to abort a queued or running task: call `cancel_task` with the `task_id`.

For any action that accepts a model, provide exactly one model source:
- `file_id` when the model is already in AgentPMT file storage.
- `file_url` when the model is available at a public HTTPS URL.

Do not invent file IDs. If the user only has a local path, first upload it through the platform file manager or ask the user to provide an accessible file URL.

#### Async Task Pattern

`render_turntable`, `render_views`, `render_custom`, `run_script`, `check_printability`, `fix_printability`, `voxel_remesh`, and `slice_for_printing` return a task immediately. Always follow this pattern:

1. Call the async action.
2. Save the returned `task_id`.
3. Poll `get_task` until `status` is `completed` or `failed`.
4. When completed, read the returned `outputs` array and give the user the `signed_url`, `file_id`, `filename`, and `size_bytes`.
5. If still processing, wait and poll again. Do not assume failure just because the first response has no file links.

`convert_format` is the exception: it returns the converted file directly in the first response. If the queue is full it returns HTTP 429 with `error_code: "GPU_RENDER_QUEUE_FULL"` and a `Retry-After` hint; back off and retry.

You may abort a task you submitted with `cancel_task` (queued or running). The task transitions to `status: "failed"` with `error_code: "GPU_RENDER_TASK_CANCELED"` once the SIGTERM grace window closes (≤30 seconds for a running render, immediate for a queued one).

#### Queue and Capacity

- The GPU serves one render at a time. Submissions queue strictly in arrival order — there is **no per-budget reordering** or fair-share. Visibility (`queue_position`, `queue_eta_seconds`) is the fairness mechanism.
- Maximum queue depth is **50**. A submission past that limit returns HTTP 429 with body `{"success": false, "output": {"error": "...", "error_code": "GPU_RENDER_QUEUE_FULL"}}` and a `Retry-After` header. Wait the suggested interval and retry.
- Container restarts: if a job was processing when the container restarted, `get_task` returns `status: "failed"` with `error_code: "GPU_RENDER_CONTAINER_RESTARTED"`. Resubmit the request.

#### Memory Limits

Each render runs under a kernel-enforced memory cap and an additional container-level backstop:

- Per-subprocess: **12 GiB**. A render that allocates beyond this fails fast with `error_code: "BLENDER_SUBPROCESS_MEMORY_LIMIT"`.
- Per-container: **14 GiB hard cap** (catastrophic backstop only — the per-subprocess cap fires first).
- `voxel_remesh` rejects requests whose grid cell count exceeds **5,000,000** with `error_code: "BLENDER_VOXEL_GRID_TOO_LARGE"`. The error message includes the minimum-safe `voxel_size`. For a 150 mm bbox the minimum-safe value is ≈ 0.31 mm; smaller voxels make the grid blow up cubically.
- `run_script` rejects payloads larger than **64 KiB** with `error_code: "BLENDER_RUN_SCRIPT_TOO_LARGE"`. Reach for `convert_format` or `render_views` if the script is just orchestrating a few API calls.

#### Input And Output Rules

Supported model inputs for standard render/convert actions are BLEND, GLB, GLTF, FBX, OBJ, STL, DAE, and PLY.

Supported `convert_format` outputs are `blend`, `glb`, `fbx`, `obj`, `stl`, `dae`, and `ply`.

`fix_printability` re-exports the cleaned mesh and supports a smaller subset (`stl`, `glb`, `obj`, `ply`) — formats designed for 3D-printing pipelines.

`slice_for_printing` accepts the same model inputs as the renderers and returns a `.gcode` file plus a Blender-rendered "model on the printbed" preview PNG with the print-time and filament numbers overlaid.

Every model-taking action accepts `source_units` (see "Units") to declare the unit basis of the input file when it cannot be inferred.

For `run_script`, any files saved directly inside `OUTPUT_DIR` are uploaded automatically. Use `output_type` to tell the tool what files to return:
- `image` returns image outputs such as `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and `.webp`.
- `video` returns video outputs such as `.mp4`, `.mov`, and `.webm`.
- `model` returns model outputs such as `.blend`, `.glb`, `.gltf`, `.fbx`, `.obj`, `.stl`, `.dae`, `.ply`, and `.usdz`.
- `all` returns every regular file written to `OUTPUT_DIR`.

If `output_type` does not match the files your script writes, the task can complete with skipped files. For example, set `output_type: "model"` when saving a `.blend` file and `output_type: "video"` when writing an `.mp4`.

Blender project files are returned as generic binary downloads for broad client compatibility. They still use the `.blend` filename extension.

#### Render Quality And Framing

The standard render actions automatically center and scale models for consistent framing. Leave `camera_distance` unset unless the user explicitly asks for a manual distance.

Use these defaults for reliable results:
- Product-style previews: `lighting_preset: "product"`, `background_color: "ffffff"`, `fit_margin: 1.35` to `1.6`, `camera_lens_mm: 28` to `35`.
- General studio previews: `lighting_preset: "studio"`, default background, default framing.
- Fast draft previews: out-of-the-box defaults are tuned for this — `resolution: "720p"`, `samples: 8`, with 12-24 turntable frames for a quick spin.
- Higher quality stills: opt in with `resolution: "1080p"` or `2k` and `samples: 32` to `128`. Hero marketing renders may use `samples: 128+`.

For turntables, slower and smoother videos use more frames and longer duration. A useful default is 24 frames over 6 seconds for a quick review, or 72-96 frames over 6-8 seconds for smoother presentation.

The service renders with Cycles on an NVIDIA L4 GPU in production (Cloud Run); local dev falls back to CPU when no GPU is attached. Very large `samples` × `resolution` × `frames` combinations will still hit the per-action timeout cap even on GPU; choose the fast defaults for previews and only opt in to higher quality when the output justifies the wait. For very heavy STL imports, `decimate_ratio` lowers polygon count before rendering and is the right control to reach for instead of dropping resolution.

#### Units

Every action that takes a model normalizes it to real-world size before doing anything else, using one rule set:

- `source_units` (optional on every model-taking action): `auto` (default), `mm`, `cm`, `m`, `in`, or `native`.
- `auto` means: an STL whose header declares a unit (Onshape writes `Units = meters`) is read in that unit; otherwise STL / OBJ / PLY are read as **millimetres** (the 3D-printing convention PrusaSlicer also assumes) and glTF / GLB / FBX / DAE / BLEND are read as their own native units.
- Set `source_units` explicitly when a mesh was written in another unit without saying so (for example `source_units: "m"` for a metre-valued STL with a blank header).
- All reported sizes are real-world: `model_stats.bounding_box_mm`, `volume_mm3`, `voxel_size`, `bbox_before`, `metadata.max_layer_z_mm` are millimetres regardless of what the file declared.
- STL / OBJ / PLY outputs from `fix_printability`, `voxel_remesh` and `convert_format` are always written in millimetres, so they round-trip through `check_printability` and `slice_for_printing` at the same size. glTF / GLB / FBX / DAE / BLEND are written native.
- Responses include a `units` block (`source_units_requested`, `source_units_resolved`, `import_scale_to_meters`, `stl_header_units`, plus `export_units` / `slicer_scale` where relevant) so you can confirm the basis that was applied.

#### Printability QA

`check_printability` and `fix_printability` use Blender's `object_print3d_utils` addon to surface the geometric problems an FFF/FDM printer slicer cannot recover from. The model is normalized to real-world units first (see "Units"), so `thickness_min_mm` and the degenerate-face threshold (`0.01 mm²`, faces smaller than a 0.4 mm nozzle can resolve) mean the same thing for a mm-valued and a metre-valued file.

The single contract for `summary.is_printable`:

> A model is printable iff it has no non-manifold edges, no non-manifold vertices, no self-intersecting faces, and no degenerate faces or edges.

Distorted faces, thin walls (below `thickness_min_mm`), and steep overhangs (above `overhang_angle_deg`) are all reported as `warning_count` rather than blockers — they are slicer-tunable and printer-dependent (an SLA printer can print steeper overhangs than an FDM printer; supports usually rescue most overhangs anyway).

##### Choosing between `fix_printability` and `voxel_remesh`

Both repair actions produce a printable export. They use different techniques and have different trade-offs — pick based on the *severity* of the input's issues:

- **`fix_printability`** runs Blender's lightweight clean operators (clean-non-manifold, clean-distorted). Preserves fine surface detail. The right tool when `check_printability` reports a small number of issues (dozens to a few hundred), typically from CAD exports or hand-modeled meshes with a few stray non-manifolds. If the input is structurally broken, this action's clean operators can actually make the metrics worse.
- **`voxel_remesh`** rebuilds the entire mesh from a uniform voxel grid via OpenVDB. Guaranteed manifold output. Loses sub-voxel surface detail (smooths fine grooves, embossed text smaller than the voxel size). The right tool for organic 3D-modeled / sculpted shapes, photogrammetry exports, self-intersecting Boolean unions, inverted-normal regions, and dense multi-shell tessellation problems. Typically the only thing that fixes Meshy / sculpting / photogrammetry output. The auto-scaled voxel size keeps tentacle-class silhouette features intact on a normal-sized print.

A reasonable default workflow: call `check_printability` first; if `summary.issue_count` is in the dozens or low hundreds, try `fix_printability`. If it's in the thousands, go straight to `voxel_remesh`.

#### Slicing

`slice_for_printing` ships one bundled printer profile, `prusa_mk4_pla_020`, an Original Prusa MK4 with the 0.4mm nozzle, Generic PLA filament, and the 0.20mm QUALITY print profile (250 × 210 mm bed, 0.2mm layers, 15% infill, no supports). The override fields (`layer_height_mm`, `infill_density_pct`, `support_material`) apply on top of that profile per call. The action returns:

- `model.gcode` — the actual G-code that a printer can stream from.
- `slice_preview.png` — a Blender-rendered image showing the model resting on a printbed-sized plane in roughly PrusaSlicer's default 3D-view orientation, with print-time / filament / layer / profile-name lines overlaid in the bottom-right corner. This is a wayfinding visual, not a hero render. The model and the bed share one unit basis (see "Units"), so the model appears at true size on the bed.
- `metadata` — the parsed time / filament fields from the slicer's gcode comment block, plus `total_layers` and `max_layer_z_mm` counted from the per-layer `;LAYER_CHANGE` / `;Z:` markers when the slicer omits a summary line.
- `units` — the unit basis applied to the input and the `--scale` (if any) passed to the slicer.

#### Security And Script Safety

Blender starts with Python auto-execution disabled when loading files, including user-provided `.blend` inputs.

`run_script` executes the script in Blender, so keep scripts scoped to the requested task. Save only intended outputs into `OUTPUT_DIR`. Do not assume application source files, credentials, or other task working directories are available.

#### Actions

##### render_turntable

Generate a spinning turntable video of a 3D model with professional lighting. Returns a task_id immediately.

**Required fields:**
- `file_url` or `file_id` — the 3D model (BLEND, GLB, FBX, OBJ, STL, DAE, PLY)

**Optional fields:**
- `frames` (int, 12-120, default 72) — number of animation frames
- `duration_seconds` (float, 1-30, default 6) — video length in seconds
- `resolution` (string, default "720p") — 720p, 1080p, 2k, 4k, or custom WxH. Raise to 1080p or higher for hero output; the default is tuned for fast previews.
- `samples` (int, 1-512, default 8) — render quality (higher = better but slower). Raise to 32-64 for hero stills, 128+ for marketing renders.
- `background_color` (hex string without #, default "1a1a1a") — background color
- `lighting_preset` (string, default "studio") — studio, product, outdoor, dramatic
- `elevation` (float, -45 to 90, default 25) — camera elevation angle in degrees
- `camera_distance` (float, optional) — explicit camera distance; omit for automatic full-object framing
- `camera_lens_mm` (float, 10-120, default 35) — focal length in mm; lower is wider
- `fit_margin` (float, 1-3, default 1.25) — auto-framing padding; higher leaves more space around the model
- `decimate_ratio` (float, 0.05-1.0, optional) — polygon-reduction ratio applied before rendering. 0.5 keeps half the faces, 0.2 keeps a fifth, omit (or 1.0) for full fidelity. Use for very heavy STL imports of organic / 3D-print geometry where preview-quality renders are acceptable.

**Example — basic turntable:**
```json
{"action": "render_turntable", "file_url": "https://example.com/model.glb"}
```

- `camera_distance` (float, optional) — explicit camera distance; omit for automatic full-object framing
- `camera_lens_mm` (float, 10-120, default 35) — focal length in mm; lower is wider
- `fit_margin` (float, 1-3, default 1.25) — auto-framing padding; higher leaves more space around the model
- `decimate_ratio` (float, 0.05-1.0, optional) — polygon-reduction ratio applied before rendering. Same semantics as render_turntable.

**Example — all default views:**
```json
{"action": "render_views", "file_url": "https://example.com/model.glb"}
```

**Example — specific views with product lighting:**
```json

---

##### render_custom

Render with a custom camera position, target, and field of view. Returns a task_id immediately.

**Required fields:**
- `file_url` or `file_id`

**Optional fields:**
- `camera_position` (array [x, y, z], default [3, -3, 2.5]) — camera world position
- `look_at` (array [x, y, z], default [0, 0, 0]) — point the camera looks at
- `fov` (float, 10-120, default 50) — focal length in mm (lower = wider angle)
- `resolution`, `samples`, `background_color`, `lighting_preset`

**Example — close-up from the front:**
```json
{"action": "render_custom", "file_url": "https://example.com/model.glb", "camera_position": [0, -3, 1], "look_at": [0, 0, 0.5], "fov": 35}
```

**Example — bird's eye view:**
```json
{"action": "render_custom", "file_url": "https://example.com/building.glb", "camera_position": [0, 0, 8], "look_at": [0, 0, 0], "fov": 50, "lighting_preset": "outdoor"}
```

```

---

##### convert_format

Convert a 3D model between file formats using Blender's importers and exporters. Runs **synchronously** (returns result immediately).

**Required fields:**
- `file_url` or `file_id` — the source 3D model
- `output_format` (string) — target format: blend, glb, fbx, obj, stl, dae, ply

**Optional fields:**
- `apply_transforms` (boolean, default true) — apply location, rotation, and scale transforms before interchange-format export. Ignored for `blend` output so editable Blender scene transforms are preserved.
- `source_units` (string, default `auto`) — unit basis of the input; see "Units". STL / OBJ / PLY outputs are written in millimetres, glTF / GLB / FBX / DAE / BLEND natively (glTF is metres by spec). The response includes a `units` block.

**Example — FBX to GLB for web:**
```json
{"action": "convert_format", "file_url": "https://example.com/model.fbx", "output_format": "glb"}
```

**Example — GLB to STL for 3D printing:**
```json
{"action": "convert_format", "file_id": "abc-123-def", "output_format": "stl"}
```

**Example — OBJ to FBX for Unity:**
```json
{"action": "convert_format", "file_url": "https://example.com/model.obj", "output_format": "fbx"}
```

**Example — GLB to Blender project file:**
```json
{"action": "convert_format", "file_id": "abc-123-def", "output_format": "blend"}
```
Blender project files are returned as generic binary downloads for broad client compatibility.

**Typical time:** Under 5 seconds for most models.

---

##### check_printability

Run a structured 3D-printability analysis on a model using Blender's bundled `object_print3d_utils` addon. Read-only — no upload, no mesh mutation. Returns a task_id immediately.

**Required fields:**
- `file_url` or `file_id` — the 3D model

**Optional fields:**
- `checks` (array of strings, default all six) — subset of `solid`, `intersect`, `degenerate`, `distort`, `thick`, `overhang`
- `thickness_min_mm` (float, 0.05-10.0, default 0.5) — wall-thickness threshold
- `overhang_angle_deg` (float, 10-89, default 45.0) — overhang threshold
- `distort_angle_deg` (float, 5-89, default 45.0) — face-distortion threshold
- `source_units` (string, default `auto`) — unit basis of the file; see "Units"

**Response shape (in `outputs[0]`):** `type: "printability_report"`, `summary.is_printable` (bool), `summary.issue_count`, `summary.warning_count`, `results.{solid,intersect,degenerate,distort,thick,overhang}` per-check counts, `thresholds` (including `degenerate_threshold_mm2`), a `units` block, and a `model_stats` block with vertex/face/edge counts and `bounding_box_mm` / `volume_mm3` in real-world millimetres. `is_printable` is `true` only when the mesh is manifold, non-self-intersecting, and free of degenerate geometry (faces of 0.01 mm² or less) — distorted faces, thin walls, and steep overhangs register as warnings, not blockers. Sanity-check `model_stats.bounding_box_mm` against the size you expect; if it is off by 1000x, pass `source_units` explicitly.

**Example — full default check:**
```json
{"action": "check_printability", "file_url": "https://example.com/model.glb"}
```

**Example — custom thickness threshold:**
```json
{"action": "check_printability", "file_id": "abc-123-def", "thickness_min_mm": 1.2}
```

**Example — only the manifold + intersect checks:**
```json
{"action": "check_printability", "file_url": "https://example.com/model.glb", "checks": ["solid", "intersect"]}
```

---

##### fix_printability

Run the same checks, then attempt the addon's auto-clean operators and re-export the cleaned mesh in the requested format. Returns a task_id immediately.

**Required fields:**
- `file_url` or `file_id`
- `output_format` (string) — `stl`, `glb`, `obj`, or `ply`

**Optional fields:**
- `auto_fix_non_manifold` (boolean, default true) — run `print3d_clean_non_manifold`
- `auto_fix_distorted` (boolean, default true) — run `print3d_clean_distorted`
- `checks`, `thickness_min_mm`, `overhang_angle_deg`, `distort_angle_deg`, `source_units` — same as `check_printability`

**Response shape (in `outputs[0]`):** all the fields of `check_printability` PLUS `before` and `after` blocks with the per-check results, a `fixes_applied` array (e.g. `["non_manifold", "distorted"]`), a `model_stats` block split into `before`/`after`, and the standard upload fields `signed_url`, `file_id`, `filename`, `size_bytes` for the cleaned export. STL / OBJ / PLY exports are written in millimetres (`units.export_units`), so a 73 mm part stays 73 mm when re-checked or sliced.

**Example — fix and export STL:**
```json
{"action": "fix_printability", "file_url": "https://example.com/model.glb", "output_format": "stl"}
```

**Example — only run the manifold cleanup, skip distorted:**
```json
{"action": "fix_printability", "file_id": "abc-123-def", "output_format": "stl", "auto_fix_distorted": false}
```

**Example — tighter thin-wall threshold for fine-detail prints:**
```json
{"action": "fix_printability", "file_url": "https://example.com/figurine.glb", "output_format": "stl", "thickness_min_mm": 0.8}
```

##### voxel_remesh

Rebuild a model into a watertight manifold via OpenVDB voxel remesh. Returns a task_id immediately.

The right tool for inputs that are structurally broken — meshes the lightweight `fix_printability` operators cannot rescue:

- 3D-modeled / sculpted organic shapes with overlapping geometry (tentacles, character models, organic planters)
- Photogrammetry exports with shell artifacts
- Self-intersecting Boolean union output from sloppy CAD
- Inverted-normal regions
- Dense multi-shell tessellation problems on heavily-decimated meshes

The output is **guaranteed manifold** (no non-manifold edges or self-intersections, normals consistently pointed outward). The trade-off is that surface detail smaller than the voxel size gets smoothed away.

**Required fields:**
- `file_url` or `file_id`
- `output_format` (string) — `stl`, `glb`, `obj`, or `ply`

**Optional fields:**
- `voxel_size` (float, 0.01–100.0) — explicit voxel size in **millimetres** (the model is normalized to real-world units first; see "Units"). Smaller values preserve more detail at the cost of compute time. Omit to auto-scale to ~1.3% of the longest bounding-box dimension with a 0.5 mm floor, which works well for most print-scale models.
- `source_units` (string, default `auto`) — unit basis of the file; see "Units"

**Response shape (in `outputs[0]`):** `type: "voxel_remesh_report"`, `voxel_size` (mm, `voxel_size_units: "mm"`), `voxel_size_source: "auto"|"override"`, `bbox_before` (3-tuple, mm), `before` and `after` blocks with manifold metrics (`vertices`, `faces`, `edges`, `non_manifold_edges`, `non_manifold_verts`, `bad_contiguous_edges`), `is_manifold_after` (bool), and the standard upload fields `signed_url`, `file_id`, `filename`, `size_bytes` for the remeshed export (STL / OBJ / PLY written in millimetres).

**Example — repair an organic 3D-modeled mesh:**
```json
{"action": "voxel_remesh", "file_url": "https://example.com/sculpt.glb", "output_format": "stl"}
```

**Example — finer detail for a small jewelry-class model:**
```json
{"action": "voxel_remesh", "file_id": "abc-123-def", "output_format": "stl", "voxel_size": 0.3}
```

**Example — coarser remesh for a large statue (faster, smaller output):**
```json
{"action": "voxel_remesh", "file_url": "https://example.com/statue.glb", "output_format": "glb", "voxel_size": 5.0}
```

##### slice_for_printing

Slice a model with PrusaSlicer's headless CLI against a bundled printer profile (default: `prusa_mk4_pla_020`, an Original Prusa MK4 with 0.4mm nozzle, Generic PLA, 0.20 mm QUALITY). Returns the gcode, a Blender-rendered "model on the printbed" preview PNG with the print-time and filament numbers overlaid in the corner, and parsed metadata. Returns a task_id immediately.

**Required fields:**
- `file_url` or `file_id`

**Optional fields:**
- `printer_profile` (string, default `prusa_mk4_pla_020`) — bundled profile name (lowercase letters, digits, underscores)
- `layer_height_mm` (float, 0.05-0.6) — override the slicer's layer height; omit to use the profile's value
- `infill_density_pct` (int, 0-100) — override infill density percent
- `support_material` (boolean) — override the support-material toggle
- `source_units` (string, default `auto`) — unit basis of the file; see "Units". A metre-valued STL is rescaled for the slicer automatically when its header says so, or when you pass `source_units: "m"`.

**Response shape (in `outputs[0]`):** `type: "slice_result"`, `printer_profile`, `bed_dimensions_mm`, `units` (`source_units_resolved`, `slicer_scale`, ...), `metadata.{estimated_print_time_seconds,estimated_print_time_formatted,filament_used_mm,filament_used_g,filament_used_cm3,filament_cost,total_layers,max_layer_z_mm}`, `gcode.{signed_url,file_id,filename,size_bytes}` for `model.gcode`, and `preview.{signed_url,file_id,filename,size_bytes}` for `slice_preview.png` (the printbed preview with the metadata overlay). `total_layers` / `max_layer_z_mm` are counted from the gcode's per-layer markers, so they are populated even when the slicer writes no summary line.

**Example — default slice:**
```json
{"action": "slice_for_printing", "file_url": "https://example.com/model.glb"}
```

**Example — finer 0.10 mm layers:**
```json
{"action": "slice_for_printing", "file_id": "abc-123-def", "layer_height_mm": 0.10}
```

**Example — force supports off and 30% infill:**
```json
{"action": "slice_for_printing", "file_url": "https://example.com/model.glb", "support_material": false, "infill_density_pct": 30}
```

---

##### run_script

Execute a custom Blender Python script on a model for advanced operations. Returns a task_id immediately.

**Required fields:**
- `script` (string) — Blender Python code to execute

**Optional fields:**
- `file_url` or `file_id` — model to load before running the script (optional; the script can create from scratch)
- `output_type` (string) — image, video, model, all. Hint for what the script produces. Use `model` for `.blend`, `.glb`, `.fbx`, `.obj`, `.stl`, `.dae`, `.ply`, and `.usdz` outputs.
- `script_timeout_seconds` (int, 600-1800, optional) — override the per-subprocess timeout for this run. The default is auto-scaled based on the rendered resolution and samples. Use this only when a script genuinely needs more than the default budget; it cannot exceed the service maximum (1800s).

**Available variables in the script:**
- `bpy` — the full Blender Python API
- `MODEL_PATH` — filesystem path to the downloaded model (empty string if no model provided)
- `OUTPUT_DIR` — directory to save output files. All files saved here are automatically uploaded and returned in the task outputs.

**Example — render with Cycles ray-tracing:**
```json
{
  "action": "run_script",
  "file_url": "https://example.com/model.glb",
  "script": "import bpy, os\nbpy.ops.import_scene.gltf(filepath=MODEL_PATH)\nbpy.context.scene.render.engine = 'CYCLES'\nbpy.context.scene.cycles.samples = 128\nbpy.context.scene.render.resolution_x = 1920\nbpy.context.scene.render.resolution_y = 1080\ncam = bpy.data.cameras.new('Cam')\ncam_obj = bpy.data.objects.new('Cam', cam)\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.link(cam_obj)\nbpy.context.scene.camera = cam_obj\ncam_obj.location = (4, -4, 3)\ntrack = cam_obj.constraints.new('TRACK_TO')\nempty = bpy.data.objects.new('T', None)\nempty.location = (0, 0, 0)\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.link(empty)\ntrack.target = empty\ntrack.track_axis = 'TRACK_NEGATIVE_Z'\ntrack.up_axis = 'UP_Y'\nlight = bpy.data.lights.new('Sun', 'SUN')\nlight.energy = 5\nlight_obj = bpy.data.objects.new('Sun', light)\nlight_obj.rotation_euler = (0.8, 0, 0.5)\nbpy.context.scene.collection.objects.link(light_obj)\nbpy.context.scene.render.filepath = os.path.join(OUTPUT_DIR, 'render.png')\nbpy.ops.render.render(write_still=True)"
}
```

**Example — get model statistics:**
```json
{
  "action": "run_script",
  "file_url": "https://example.com/model.glb",
  "script": "import bpy, os, json\nbpy.ops.import_scene.gltf(filepath=MODEL_PATH)\nmeshes = [o for o in bpy.context.scene.objects if o.type == 'MESH']\nstats = {'meshes': len(meshes), 'total_vertices': sum(len(m.data.vertices) for m in meshes), 'total_faces': sum(len(m.data.polygons) for m in meshes)}\nwith open(os.path.join(OUTPUT_DIR, 'stats.json'), 'w') as f:\n    json.dump(stats, f, indent=2)"
}
```

**Example — apply a subdivision modifier and re-export:**
```json
{
  "action": "run_script",
  "file_url": "https://example.com/lowpoly.glb",
  "script": "import bpy, os\nbpy.ops.import_scene.gltf(filepath=MODEL_PATH)\nfor obj in bpy.context.scene.objects:\n    if obj.type == 'MESH':\n        mod = obj.modifiers.new('Subdiv', 'SUBSURF')\n        mod.levels = 2\nbpy.ops.export_scene.gltf(filepath=os.path.join(OUTPUT_DIR, 'subdivided.glb'), export_format='GLB')"
}
```

**Example — save the processed scene as a Blender file:**
```json
{
  "action": "run_script",
  "file_url": "https://example.com/model.glb",
  "output_type": "model",
  "script": "import bpy, os\nbpy.ops.import_scene.gltf(filepath=MODEL_PATH)\nbpy.ops.wm.save_as_mainfile(filepath=os.path.join(OUTPUT_DIR, 'scene.blend'))"
}
```

---

##### get_task

Check the status of a render task and retrieve download links when complete.

**Required fields:**
- `task_id` (string) — the task ID returned from any async render action

**Example:**
```json
{"action": "get_task", "task_id": "849b4c79-2c2e-4886-bd40-1c01a8a2bd1d"}
```

**Response when processing:**
```json
{"action": "get_task", "task_id": "849b4c79...", "status": "processing", "progress": 25, "stage": "running_checks", "date_updated": "2026-09-11T14:02:11+00:00", "queue_position": 0, "queue_eta_seconds": 60, "queue_stats": {"queue_total_running": 1, "queue_total_queued": 2, "queue_total_capacity": 50}}
```

`queue_position` is `0` when the task is running, `N` when it is the Nth slot from the front of the queue. `queue_eta_seconds` is the best-guess wait until the task is dequeued (always `0` for a running task). `queue_stats` summarizes the current queue state. All three fields are omitted on terminal records.

`progress` is **coarse**: it advances only at stage boundaries (queued → started → downloading_model → running_checks / slicing / rendering → uploading), not continuously, so it can sit at one value for the whole Blender or slicer run. Key off `status` for completion, `stage` for what the worker is doing, and `date_updated` as a heartbeat; a task whose `date_updated` is more than a few minutes old with no `stage` change is the one to `cancel_task`. Never treat a flat `progress` alone as "hung".

**Response when completed:**
```json
{"action": "get_task", "task_id": "849b4c79...", "status": "completed", "progress": 100, "outputs": [{"type": "video", "signed_url": "https://...", "file_id": "...", "size_bytes": 426703}]}
```

**Response when failed:**
```json
{"action": "get_task", "task_id": "849b4c79...", "status": "failed", "error": "Blender exited with code 1."}
```

The `error` field contains a sanitized message — `"Blender timed out after Ns."`, `"Blender exited with code N."`, `"ffmpeg timed out after Ns."`, or a validation message — where `N` reflects the auto-scaled per-action timeout in effect, not a fixed wall.

---

##### cancel_task

Cancel a queued or running task. Idempotent: cancelling an already-terminal task returns an error explaining that.

**Required fields:**
- `task_id` (string) — the task ID returned from any async render action.

**Example — cancel a queued task:**
```json
{"action": "cancel_task", "task_id": "849b4c79-2c2e-4886-bd40-1c01a8a2bd1d"}
```

**Response (success):**
```json
{"action": "cancel_task", "task_id": "849b4c79...", "cancel_outcome": "queued_or_running_canceled"}
```

The task itself transitions to `status: "failed"` with `error_code: "GPU_RENDER_TASK_CANCELED"` once the SIGTERM grace window closes (≤30 seconds for a running render, immediate for a queued one). Poll `get_task` to confirm the terminal state.

**Cancel a running task:**
```json
{"action": "cancel_task", "task_id": "1b4f2acc-ff15-4b86-9d6d-2bd1c3a1b1d1"}
```

The semantics are identical — cancellation does not block awaiting subprocess termination; the response returns immediately and the task moves to terminal state asynchronously.

---

##### list_tasks

List all render tasks for the current user, most recent first.

**Optional fields:**
- `limit` (int, 1-100, default 20) — maximum tasks to return

**Example:**
```json
{"action": "list_tasks", "limit": 10}
```

**Response:**
```json
{"action": "list_tasks", "count": 3, "tasks": [{"task_id": "...", "action": "render_turntable", "status": "completed", "progress": 100, "outputs": [...]}, {"task_id": "...", "action": "render_views", "status": "processing", "progress": 45}]}
```

---

#### Recommended Workflows

##### Basic render workflow
1. Call `render_turntable` or `render_views` with your model URL — get a `task_id`
2. Wait 1-5 minutes depending on complexity
3. Call `get_task` with the `task_id`
4. If `status` is `"completed"`, the `outputs` array has download links
5. If `status` is still `"processing"`, check `progress` and wait a bit longer

##### Multiple renders at once
Submit multiple render requests — they run in parallel:
```json
{"action": "render_turntable", "file_url": "https://...", "lighting_preset": "studio"}
{"action": "render_views", "file_url": "https://...", "views": ["front", "3quarter"]}
```
Then use `list_tasks` to see all of them at once, or `get_task` on each individually.

##### Generate a 3D model and render it
1. Use the 3D Modeling Agent to create a model from text or image
2. Take the GLB download URL from the completed task
3. Pass it to `render_turntable` or `render_views` to get professional renders
4. Use `convert_format` to export to FBX for Unity or STL for 3D printing

#### Lighting Presets

| Preset | Description | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| studio | 3-point lighting (key, fill, rim). Neutral white, soft shadows. | Product shots, portfolio renders, general purpose |
| product | Large soft overhead light with bottom fill. Clean, even illumination. | E-commerce product photography, catalogs |
| outdoor | Sun lamp with ambient sky fill. Natural daylight feel. | Architectural models, outdoor scenes |
| dramatic | Single hard spotlight from the side. Deep shadows, dark background. | Character models, cinematic presentations, game assets |

#### Supported Formats

| Direction | Formats |
|-----------|---------|
| Import | BLEND, GLB, GLTF, FBX, OBJ, STL, DAE, PLY |
| Export (convert_format) | BLEND, GLB, FBX, OBJ, STL, DAE, PLY |
| Export (fix_printability / voxel_remesh) | STL, GLB, OBJ, PLY |
| Slicer output | G-code (`.gcode`) + printbed preview PNG |

#### Notes

- Models are automatically centered and scaled for consistent framing across all render actions.
- Unit handling is uniform across actions (see "Units"): imports are normalized to real-world size, unit-less mesh formats default to millimetres, and STL / OBJ / PLY outputs are written in millimetres.
- Blender runs with Python auto-execution disabled when loading files, including user-provided `.blend` inputs.
- Turntable videos are rendered as individual PNG frames then stitched to H.264 MP4 via ffmpeg.
- Cycles is the default render engine and runs on GPU when available, falling back to CPU automatically when no GPU is attached. Use `run_script` with `bpy.context.scene.render.engine = 'BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT'` only if you need EEVEE specifically.
- Output files are stored for 7 days via signed URLs.
- Each Blender subprocess runs under an auto-scaled timeout — floor 10 minutes (600s) for trivial work, scaling with frames × resolution × samples × view count, capped at 30 minutes (1800s). Very large requests (high samples, 4K resolution, many frames or views) hit the cap and may time out; choose the fast defaults for previews and only opt in to higher quality when the output justifies the wait.
- The `run_script` action gives full access to the Blender Python API. Save output files to `OUTPUT_DIR` and they are automatically uploaded.

Supported action count: `12`.
x402 availability: not enabled for this product.

- `cancel_task` (action slug: `cancel-task`): Cancel a queued or running render task. Idempotent: cancelling an already-terminal task returns an error explaining that. Queued tasks transition immediately; running tasks transition once the SIGTERM grace window closes (≤30s). The task ends with status='failed' and error_code='GPU_RENDER_TASK_CANCELED'. Poll get_task to confirm the terminal state. Price: `25` credits. Parameters: `task_id`.
- `check_printability` (action slug: `check-printability`): Run a structured 3D-printability analysis using Blender's object_print3d_utils addon. Read-only — no upload, no mesh mutation. Returns a task_id immediately. Price: `25` credits. Parameters: `checks`, `distort_angle_deg`, `file_id`, `file_url`, `overhang_angle_deg`, `source_units`, `thickness_min_mm`.
- `convert_format` (action slug: `convert-format`): Convert a 3D model between file formats. Runs synchronously through the queue; if the queue is full, returns 429 with error_code GPU_RENDER_QUEUE_FULL. Price: `25` credits. Parameters: `apply_transforms`, `file_id`, `file_url`, `output_format`, `source_units`.
- `fix_printability` (action slug: `fix-printability`): Light-touch repair using Blender's object_print3d_utils clean operators. For mostly-clean inputs (CAD exports, few stray non-manifolds). Use voxel_remesh for structurally-broken inputs. Price: `25` credits.

- `get_task` (action slug: `get-task`): Check the status of a render task and retrieve download links when complete. Non-terminal responses include stage (what the worker is doing: queued, started, downloading_model, running_checks, slicing, rendering_preview, uploading_...) and date_updated as a heartbeat; progress is coarse and only advances at stage boundaries, so key off status and stage rather than a flat progress value. They also include queue_position (0 when running, 1+ when queued), queue_eta_seconds, and queue_stats {queue_total_running, queue_total_queued, queue_total_capacity}. Caller-driven failures (GPU_RENDER_QUEUE_FULL, BLENDER_VOXEL_GRID_TOO_LARGE, BLENDER_RUN_SCRIPT_TOO_LARGE, GPU_RENDER_TASK_CANCELED, BLENDER_SLICER_PROFILE_INVALID) report at warning severity and are safe to retry with corrected inputs; subprocess / memory / timeout failures (GPU_RENDER_BLENDER_NONZERO_EXIT, GPU_RENDER_BLENDER_TIMEOUT, BLENDER_SUBPROCESS_MEMORY_LIMIT, GPU_RENDER_CONTAINER_RESTARTED, GPU_RENDER_UNEXPECTED_ERROR) report at error severity — retry once but escalate if it recurs. Price: `25` credits. Parameters: `task_id`.
- `list_tasks` (action slug: `list-tasks`): List render tasks for the current user, most recent first. Price: `25` credits. Parameters: `limit`.

- `run_script` (action slug: `run-script`): Execute a custom Blender Python script. Returns a task_id immediately. Script payload limited to 65,536 bytes — oversize requests fail with error_code BLENDER_RUN_SCRIPT_TOO_LARGE. Price: `25` credits. Parameters: `file_id`, `file_url`, `output_type`, `script`, `script_timeout_seconds`, `source_units`.
- `slice_for_printing` (action slug: `slice-for-printing`): Slice a 3D model with PrusaSlicer and return G-code, parsed metadata, and a Blender-rendered printbed preview PNG. Returns a task_id immediately. Price: `25` credits. Parameters: `file_id`, `file_url`, `infill_density_pct`, `layer_height_mm`, `printer_profile`, `source_units`, `support_material`.
- `voxel_remesh` (action slug: `voxel-remesh`): Rebuild a model into a watertight manifold via OpenVDB voxel remesh. The right tool for structurally-broken inputs. Output is guaranteed manifold; surface detail smaller than the voxel size is smoothed away. Pre-flight rejects requests whose grid cell count exceeds 5,000,000 with error_code BLENDER_VOXEL_GRID_TOO_LARGE — the response message includes the minimum-safe voxel_size for the input, and the report context exposes bbox_x/y/z, voxel_size, cells, max_cells, and min_safe_voxel_size for runbooks. Price: `25` credits. Parameters: `file_id`, `file_url`, `output_format`, `source_units`, `voxel_size`.

## Live Schema And Examples
Use the compact schema above for ordinary calls. Before a new production integration, or whenever parameters, enum values, nested objects, outputs, or examples are unclear, fetch live details first.
